"""Where the CodeScene token may be bound in the publisher, as readings.

Separated from ``codescene_publisher``, whose subject is the publisher's
shape as a whole, so neither module outgrows the 400-line limit. The
subject here is the token: a check step binds it and reports only
whether it is set, and the upload takes it as its ``access-token``
input and nowhere else. The upload action is composite and hands its
step ``env`` to nested upload-artifact and cache steps, so the token is
refused there.
