"""What the single CodeScene publisher must look like, as readings.

CV-005 gives the upload to one workflow that runs on pushes to main and
serves no pull request. Its upload step is guarded on the ref as well as
the token, binds the token itself and nowhere else, and its runs queue
rather than cancel. Every reading is pure over supplied documents and
returns the violations it finds, so a contract can drive it over a
constructed workflow as readily as over this repository's own.
