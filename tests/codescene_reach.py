"""What puts CodeScene in reach of a pull request, as readings.

CV-005 keeps CodeScene off the pull-request surface by every road: the
upload action, the ``cs-coverage`` command, the ``CS_ACCESS_TOKEN``
secret, and the service's host. Each reading here is pure over one
parsed document and reads every key and value in it, case-folded, rather
than the scopes a breach is expected in: a workflow-level
``defaults.run.shell``, a ``workflow_call`` secret declaration, and a
reusable-workflow input all reach a process, and a reading that
enumerated scopes left the rest as a way round the rule. Comments are not
read, because the parser discards them, so prose explaining the policy
is not mistaken for a breach of it.
