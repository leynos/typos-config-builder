"""CV-005: CodeScene coverage belongs to main, and to main alone.

One workflow uploads coverage to CodeScene: ``coverage-main.yml``, on
pushes to main. Nothing a pull request can run, directly or through a
local reusable workflow or action, names the upload action, runs
``cs-coverage``, reaches ``CS_ACCESS_TOKEN``, or names the CodeScene host.
The pull-request lane keeps ``generate-coverage`` with the ratchet,
against the baseline the publisher writes, and publishes nothing.

The rule is a policy rather than a gap. A fork cannot read the token, so
a changed-line check on the pull-request lane was a silent skip for the
contributions least likely to have been measured, and when the CodeScene
project stopped returning a gates configuration that check failed every
pull request over a defect in none of them. What CV-005 unpins is the
call, not the artefact: the uploader pins the CLI through its own
manifest, but the CLI talks to an API whose answers have changed shape.

These tests read this repository's files. The constructed cases proving
that each clause catches what it names are in
``test_codescene_closure_cases.py`` and
``test_codescene_publisher_cases.py``.
