"""Constructed publisher cases proving each CV-005 publisher clause.

The repository's own publisher uses one spelling of everything, so a
clause that reads it cannot tell a working rule from a broken one. Each
case mutates a compliant publisher once and requires the named clause to
report it; the compliant publisher is driven too, so a rule refusing
everything fails here as well.
