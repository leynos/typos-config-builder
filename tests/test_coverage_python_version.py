"""Contract: each coverage call measures on a Python the project accepts.

generate-coverage builds its coverage environment on the Python the job put on
``PATH`` when nothing more specific names one. If ``actions/setup-python``
installs a version outside ``requires-python``, ``uv sync`` refuses the
interpreter and the coverage step fails; and if the two lanes measure on
different Pythons, the pull-request ratchet compares figures that are not
comparable. So every generate-coverage call must follow, in its own job, a
``setup-python`` step naming a version the project accepts, and every call in
both lanes must measure on one version. The Python a call measures on is the
one the most recent setup before it put on ``PATH``; a setup in another job,
or after the call, does not count.
