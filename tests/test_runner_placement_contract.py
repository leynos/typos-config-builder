"""Hold the workflows' Ubicloud placement to the files: expression and ceiling.

Ubicloud's cache proxy is scoped by ref, and a pull request from a fork cannot
obtain an Ubicloud runner at all. A lane that names an Ubicloud runner
therefore selects it by a runner-selection expression that falls back to the
hosted pool for a fork, and states its own ceiling, because an Ubicloud runner
is a self-hosted just-in-time runner that GitHub's six-hour cap for hosted jobs
does not bound.

The judgement is driven over constructed expressions in both directions before
the real files are asserted, because a check over this repository's own
correct workflows passes whether or not it discriminates anything.
