"""Follow local ``uses:`` references from the pull-request lanes.

Generic: nothing here knows about CodeScene. A workflow declaring only
``workflow_call`` still runs on a pull request when a pull-request job
calls it, and ``secrets: inherit`` hands it every secret the caller
holds; a local composite action runs inside the calling job. So a rule
about what a pull request can reach is a rule over this closure, not
over the workflows whose triggers name a pull request.
