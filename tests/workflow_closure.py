"""Follow local ``uses:`` references from the pull-request lanes.

Generic: nothing here knows about CodeScene. A workflow declaring only
``workflow_call`` still runs on a pull request when a pull-request job
calls it, and ``secrets: inherit`` hands it every secret the caller
holds; a local composite action runs inside the calling job. So a rule
about what a pull request can reach is a rule over this closure, not
over the workflows whose triggers name a pull request.

#: Triggers that put a workflow on the pull-request surface. The
#: ``pull_request*`` family and ``merge_group`` run a pull request's code
#: or run for it. ``workflow_run`` is included because a workflow chained
#: onto a pull-request workflow runs for that pull request, and reading
#: which workflows it names would be one more reading to get wrong.
#: ``issue_comment`` fires for comments on pull requests, holds the
#: repository's secrets, and is often written to check out the pull
#: request's head, so it is included rather than argued away. A push to
#: a branch other than main is read separately, by
#: ``_pushes_other_branches``.
